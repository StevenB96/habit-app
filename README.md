## Issues & solutions
* <Router /> tag can only be use once in the App, otherwise the links and routes don't render components correctly
- in tests with enzyme and jest:
* <BrowserRouter> tag needs to wrap the component in wrapper to avoid the error 'Link needs to be in Router'
* inconsistency in tests working and not find.lenght etc.
